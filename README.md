# NAVIGATING MILES DELIVERING SMILES
THIS IS AN ONLINE-DELIVERY-SERVICE PROJECT.
Online delivery refers to the process where various outlets deliver different products to customers based on their orders placed through mobile apps or websites, aiming to meet customer demands and provide high-quality service and satisfaction .
Online ordering and delivery systems enable customers and shops to manage things easily. While your customers can easily place orders and get their desired products delivered at their convenience, you can keep your shops organised and serve more customers.
This project can be used by different delivery platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, etc to give offers to their customers based on delivery distances.
It's a user friendly code that enables people of different age group to place their order hassle free.
